SETTING UP THE MODULE
First make sure that you are using ROS Fuerte, and that the files config.py and ROS_LaserScan_Obstruction_Detection.py are in the same directory. The package you are using the script in should have rospy and sensor_msgs as dependencies, in addition to any other dependencies your package has. Make sure both scripts are executable, and that they are in the same directory as the script importing them. Go to config.py and edit the variables according to the specifications of your laser scanner. Make a directory called ‘msg’ (no quotes) in your package, and copy ObstructionList.msg into it. Go to your CMakeLists.txt file in your package and uncomment “rosbuild_genmsg()”. Open a terminal window, navigate to your package and type ‘make’ in the command line. After your computer has completed the process, the module is ready to use.

USING THE MODULE
When writing a script which uses the functions in ROS_LaserScan_Obstruction_Detection.py, write "import ROS_LaserScan_Obstruction_Detection” preceding the point where the functions defined within it are first used. To use the library's functions, simply call the sensors() function by writing “ROS_LaserScan_Obstruction_Detection.sensors()" in the script. This will generate an “obstr” data set. If you want this data set to constantly update, call the “sensors()” function in a “while” loop. For more information on how to reference obstr, see the comments on the module’s script.
